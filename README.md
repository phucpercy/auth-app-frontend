# auth-app-frontend

This repository contains the frontend of an authentication application built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.

Application can be found at https://auth-app-nooriam.vercel.app . However, due to the domain problem, websocket sever has not been deployed, so the function of real-time notifications is not running. The rest is working fine.
